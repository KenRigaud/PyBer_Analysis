# PyBer_Analysis

#Overview of the analysis: 

This analysis was done to see where most of the rides and total fare originate from. This one done by pulling out columns and combining the data into data frames. We then took those data frames and and performed further summary statistics to find important information, such as means, modes, and sums to better analyze the data. Furthermore, we used matplotlibs library of functions to plot the data into various forms using the "object oriented interface" approach. Those findings are described in the following paragraph.

#Results: 

When analyzing the figures within the resources folder, it is much easier to visualize the difference between the city types in conjuction to date and fare. It is much harder to analyze this data based solely on values and a percentage based pie chart really helps us understand where resources should be allocated for future PyBer rides.


#Summary: 

Based on the results, I believe that there is more profit to be made in rural areas as the ride request are much higher. It would be interesting to see how much distance each ride is and calculate an average ride distance for each city type to see how much is actually made. This would provide much needed information for the revenue.
